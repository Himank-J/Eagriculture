<p align="justify"> Vertical farming is the practice of growing crops in vertically stacked layers. It often incorporates
controlled environment agriculture, which aims to optimize plant growth. Vertical farming is clearly the 
future of food production.Vertical farming can become the next big thing for India. There has been a growth in percentage of 
people making use of this practice and now would be the best time to start increasing awareness among 
individuals to learn and adopt the style of vertical farming.
As previously stated, land resource could become scarce in the near future. One of the biggest advantages 
of vertical farming is that it performed vertically i.e. in form of a stack. In easier terms farming is done in 
building shaped structure which consumes less land space. The 
climatic conditions have almost no impact on performance of vertical farming as it is performed in 
stacked shaped structure which is usually kept under a roof. Vertical farming does not make much use of 
soil for production which means that even though the chemicals used for growth are little more dangerous 
than the ones used in normal agricultural farming, it has zero impact on soil or land. The biggest factor 
which takes vertical farming ahead of normal farming is that it reduces the use of most important resource 
on earth i.e. Water. Vertical farming reduces water usage by 95% while generating a very good result 
which are all good signs towards a sustainable future.</br></p>
<h3>VertiFarm</h3>  
<p align="justify"> VertiFarm provides a system to promote the application and usage of vertical farming which is the 
modern method of agriculture. VertiFarm is a website that provides users with a platform to learn about 
vertical farming. It gives an insight into what exactly vertical farming is, what it provides, why it is the 
future of food production along with information about how it is performed, what materials or 
equipment’s are required. To promote the usage, VertiFarm provides the users with facility to buy item or 
rent them which allows user to understand practical approach towards vertical farming.

### Built With
This application is built with love, dedication, coffee and:
* Java and Hibernate </br>
<p align="justify">The entire project is made using JAVA programming language. To interact with database, hibernate is 
used. Hibernate ORM is an object-relational mapping tool for the Java programming language. It 
provides a framework for mapping an object-oriented domain model to a relational database. Hibernate 
not only takes care of the mapping from Java classes to database tables (and from Java data types to SQL 
data types), but also provides data query and retrieval facilities which means that all updates are also 
stored in database which can be retrieved as and when required.</p>

## Features 
</br>
* Users can send many to each other or on a group
* Users have the ability to send images on chat
* Admin can add other members to a group
* A small scaled user profile picture appears below seen messages (refer below screenshots)
* Small message tone can be heard when user sends a message 


<!-- Purpose -->
## Purpose 
The purpose of this project is to develop a chat application. This project is great learning step for anyone getting started with react and understanding how different features of react are implemented.
Perosnally this project helped me - 
* Master react components
* understand API calls using axios
* understand use of external servies like Chat engine in react using react-chat-engine library
